# Meetech Autonomous Car
## The project
To be able to fully understand the huge revolution happening in the automotive sector right now, and to highlight the complexity hidden behind it, we have decided to build our own self-driving car prototype:
The *MAC One*, as we kindly nicknamed it for *Meetech Autonomous Car One*!
